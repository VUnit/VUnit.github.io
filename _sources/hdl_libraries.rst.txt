HDL Libraries

VHDL
====

Builtins
--------

By default, VUnit provides bare minimal functionality for running testbenches.
In practice, most users want to use HDL utilities to reduce verbosity and improve reporting when writting tests.
VUnit includes several optional libraries in a group named *VHDL builtins* (see :meth:`add_vhdl_builtins() <vunit.ui.VUnit.add_vhdl_builtins>`):

* :vunit_file:`core <vunit/vhdl/core>`
* :vunit_file:`logging <vunit/vhdl/logging>` (see :ref:`logging_library`)
* :vunit_file:`string_ops <vunit/vhdl/string_ops>`
* :vunit_file:`check <vunit/vhdl/check>` (see :ref:`check_library`)
* :vunit_file:`dictionary <vunit/vhdl/dictionary>`
* :vunit_file:`run <vunit/vhdl/run>` (see :ref:`run_library`)
* :vunit_file:`path <vunit/vhdl/path>`

Most of the utilities are based on some internal data types providing dynamic arrays and queues (FIFOs).
See :ref:`data_types_library`.

Communication
-------------

The VUnit communication library (``com``) provides a high-level communication mechanism based on the
`actor model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model>`__.

See :meth:`add_com() <vunit.ui.VUnit.add_com>` and :ref:`com_user_guide`.

.. NOTE::
  The Communication Library depends on the builtins, which are added implicitly.

Verification Components
-----------------------

.. note:: This library is released as a *BETA* version. This means non-backwards compatible changes are still likely
  based on feedback from our users.

The VUnit Verification Component Library (VCL) contains a number of useful
:ref:`Verification Components <verification_components>` (VC) as well as a set of utilities for writing your own
verification component.
Verification components allow a better overview in the test bench by raising the abstraction level of bus transactions.
Even if you do not need the advanced features that VCs offer you may still benefit from using peer-verified models of an
AXI-bus instead of re-implementing it yourself.

See :meth:`add_verification_components() <vunit.ui.VUnit.add_verification_components>` and :ref:`vc_user_guide`.

.. NOTE::
  The VCL depends on both the Communication Library and OSVVM, which are added implicitly.

Random
------

VUnit provides random integer vector and pointer generation, based on built-in :ref:`Data Types <data_types_library>`
and OSVVM.

See :meth:`add_random() <vunit.ui.VUnit.add_random>`.

OSVVM
-----

VUnit includes the core of `OSVVM <https://github.com/osvvm/>`__ as a submodule and internal dependency of optional
libraries such as Random or Verification Components.
However, it can be added explicitly through :meth:`add_osvvm() <vunit.ui.VUnit.add_osvvm>`.

Moreover, multiple approaches are supported for using `OSVVMLibraries <https://github.com/OSVVM/OsvvmLibraries>`__ in
VUnit.
See :ref:`OSVB: Examples Â» SISO AXI4 Stream <osvb:Examples:AXI4Stream>`.

JSON-for-VHDL
-------------

VUnit includes `JSON-for-VHDL <https://github.com/Paebbels/JSON-for-VHDL>`__ as a submodule.
JSON-for-VHDL is an alternative to composite top-level generics, which supports any depth in the content structure.

See :meth:`add_json4vhdl() <vunit.ui.VUnit.add_json4vhdl>`, :vunit_file:`json4vhdl.py <vunit/json4vhdl.py>` and example
:ref:`JSON-for-VHDL <examples:vhdl:json4vhdl>`.

System Verilog
==============

Builtins
--------

See :meth:`add_verilog_builtins() <vunit.ui.VUnit.add_verilog_builtins>` and :vunit_file:`vunit_pkg.sv <vunit/verilog/vunit_pkg.sv>`.
